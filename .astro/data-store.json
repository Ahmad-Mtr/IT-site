To enhance our outreach and visibility, we embarked on an exciting project: creating a dedicated website for our club. This blog post shares the journey of building our site, highlighting the tools and technologies we used along the way.\n\n## The Vision Behind the Site\nThe primary goal of our website is to provide a platform where members and potential members can easily access information about our club. We wanted to create a space that showcases who we are, what we do, and how others can get involved. The site features several key sections:\n\n- **About Us:** This section introduces the GJU IT Club, detailing our mission, vision.\n- **Events:** Here, visitors can find information about upcoming events and activities organized by the club.\n- **Teams:** This section highlights our dedicated teams, showcasing their roles and main responsibilities to the club's initiatives.\n- **Contact Us** \n\n## Choosing the Right Tools\nTo bring our vision to life, we chose to use **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS** as our primary development tools.\n\n- *[Astro](https://astro.build)* is a modern Framework that allows us to build fast and efficient websites. Its component-based architecture made it easy for us to create reusable components for different sections of our site, furthermore, its kind community made really fast to create this Site via Themes, we've personally used a one called *[Positivus](https://github.com/manulthanura/Positivus)* to launch this in the shortest time possible.\n\n- *[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)* provided us with a utility-first approach to styling, enabling us to design a visually appealing layout without compromising on performance. The flexibility of Tailwind allowed us to customize our site extensively while maintaining a consistent look and feel.\n\n\n## The Next Steps\nAs some may have noticed, the club's logo has undergone rebranding. This change is part of upcoming initiatives targeting both club members and the university community. While we don't have specific details to reveal at this moment, expect exciting developments in the near future.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nThe creation of the GJU IT Club website marks a significant milestone in our journey as a club. It not only enhances our visibility but also serves as a hub for engagement within our community. We invite everyone to explore the site and connect with us as we continue to grow and innovate in the ever-evolving world of technology.","src/content/blog/building-website.md","c9ea77f2ba383ccf",{"html":28,"metadata":29},"\u003Cp>In the heart of GJU, the IT Club has always been dedicated to fostering a vibrant community of tech enthusiasts and innovators.
